# 'Porin Kes채' by Vent

## Summary

C64 SID song "arranged" in the [Psykoz2022](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3210) partyplace 13th of Aug 2022. 

Compofiller mashup created at the partyplace during one day.

SID 8580 preferred for listening.

## Background

Two iconic Finnish public figures, [Vesa-Matti Loiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesa-Matti_Loiri) (musician, comedian) and [Jussi Hakulinen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Hakulinen) (musician, singer-songwriter) passed away this week.

I got an idea to make homage to them with a twist, mashing up and re-arranging excerpts from their best-known songs; [Lapin Kes채](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpUY9NwGVjo) and [Joutsenlaulu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URDrfH2Rbbg).

In spite of I did not have time to wrap up all the brainstorms I got, the outcome was pleasing both myself and the audience, ending up at the 1st place in the competition. 

## Work process

The tune was composed on-site. 

Physically the arrangement work was done mostly in the party hall and the lakeside sauna cabin, last touches finalized in the outdoors yard swing. The Finnish summer weather pampered us here.

The work took somewhat 12 hours, excluding the first draft I started yesterday and went to scrap. Most sounds were re-used from my previous compo tune Moving On and slightly altered.

## Known issues

* Sounds are not really good, especially the pulse modulation loops are not smooth
* I did not have time to add the basedrum to the rhythm
* The transformation from the first part (Lapin Kes채) to the latter (Joutsenlaulu) was not really smooth, also the latter's beat and chord arrangement were not as smooth as I wanted

## Tools used

* Composed and converted to [.sid](https://www.hvsc.c64.org/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt) format with [CheeseCutter 2.9](https://theyamo.kapsi.fi/ccutter/). 
* Executable created with [KickAssembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler).
